# Building a Neural Network for Spam Detection

## Project Overview
This notebook demonstrates the development of a neural network using TensorFlow to classify emails as spam or non-spam, based on the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Conducted as an independent self-learning exercise, this project explores neural network design, data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques.

## Key Skills and Libraries
- **Neural Network Design:** Implemented using TensorFlow's Sequential API.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilised `pandas` for data manipulation and `StandardScaler` for feature standardisation.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Explored hyperparameter tuning (layers, batch sizes, epochs) using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, and AUC for performance assessment.
- **Core Libraries:** `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`.

## Usage
Refer to the notebook for the complete analysis, code implementation, and results, including detailed explanations of the neural network architecture and hyperparameter tuning process.
